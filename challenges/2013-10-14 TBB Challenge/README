** Source code **
tbb.cpp          -> Runs the parallel and sequential versions of the MVP algorithm and prints the run time, in seconds, for each. It does so for different matrix sizes. Finally it stores the results of each operation in two files: seq.txt and par.txt respectively for the sequential and the parallel algorithm.


** Makefile Instructions **
make             -> same as `make run-par'
make par         -> compiles tbb.cpp
make run-par     -> runs tbb.cpp
make compare     -> compares the text files generated by tbb.cpp (seq.txt and par.txt) using `diff'
make clean       -> removes temporary files from the current directory
