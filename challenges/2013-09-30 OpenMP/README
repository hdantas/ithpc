** Source code **
correctness.c    -> Writes the results of each version to a text file so they can be compared and ensure the results match.
OpenMP.c         -> Runs the different versions and determines the run time, in seconds, for each.

** Makefile Instructions **
make             -> same as `make OpenMP'
make OpenMP      -> compiles and runs OpenMP.c
make correctness -> compiles and runs correctness.c
make compare     -> compares the text files generated by correctness.c using `diff'
make clean       -> removes *.out and the generated txt files from the current directory
