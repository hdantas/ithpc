introduce beta on the multiplication
reduce message sizes: each node only sends data he changed and not the complete localC array
Check on startup if number of processors is square rootable and if the dimensions of the matrices can be divided by this value

Not sure
	replace (global) A and B by localA and localB so to optimize data locality???
	change char to int on file writing??
