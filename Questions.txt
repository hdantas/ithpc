Why in lab1 exercise 4-1 is the timer not reset as it shoud be?

In lab2 step 6 (page 9)
"They are the arguments of the run-script run that is provided to facilitate the running of the program 
on different process grids."
I cant find the script!

In lab 2 step 8 (page 12) where does Exchange_borders goes exactly?
Am I using the right coordinates for MPI_Sendrecv?
